This is NOT the official implementation by the authors of this model architecture. You can find the official pytorch [implementation here](https://github.com/pinterest/transformer_user_action). This repo is a **Tensorflow** implementation of [TransAct: Transformer-based Realtime User Action Model for
Recommendation at Pinterest](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3580305.3599918) by Xia, Xue, et al. **TransAct** is the ranking architecture 
used by Pinterest's Homefeed to personalize and extract users' short-term preferences from their realtime activities. The paper was presented at KDD 2023.

## Installation

### PyPI - Not Working Yet

New user registration on PyPI is temporarily suspended due to malicious attacks. Once admins enable, will add. Until then, skip ahead to the docker step.

Run the following to install:

```sh
pip install transact-tf
```

### Docker

To install the package using Docker run the following:

```sh
docker pull ghcr.io/awadalaa/transact:release
```

## Developing transact

To install `transact`, along with tools you need to develop and test, run the following in your virtualenv:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/awadalaa/transact.git
# or clone your own fork

cd transact
pip install -e .
```

To run rank and shape tests run any of the following:

```py
python -m transact.test_transact
pytest transact --verbose
```

## Usage

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from transact import TensorflowTransAct, TransActConfig

num_actions = 5
action_vocab = list(range(0, num_actions))
full_seq_len = 10
test_batch_size = 8
action_emb_dim = 32
item_emb_dim = 32
time_window_ms = 1000 * 60 * 60 * 1  # 1 hr
latest_n_emb = 10

# Generate random tensors in TensorFlow as input
action_type_seq = tf.random.uniform(shape=(test_batch_size, full_seq_len), minval=0, maxval=num_actions, dtype=tf.int32)
item_embedding_seq = tf.random.uniform(shape=(test_batch_size, full_seq_len, item_emb_dim), dtype=tf.float32)
action_time_seq = tf.random.uniform(shape=(test_batch_size, full_seq_len), minval=0, maxval=num_actions, dtype=tf.int32)
request_time = tf.random.uniform(shape=(test_batch_size,), minval=500000, maxval=1000000, dtype=tf.int32)
item_embedding = tf.random.uniform(shape=(test_batch_size, item_emb_dim), dtype=tf.float32)
input_features = (
    action_type_seq,
    item_embedding_seq,
    action_time_seq,
    request_time,
    item_embedding,
)

# Initialize the transact module
transact_config = TransActConfig(
    action_vocab=action_vocab,
    action_emb_dim=action_emb_dim,
    item_emb_dim=item_emb_dim,
    time_window_ms=time_window_ms,
    latest_n_emb=latest_n_emb,
    seq_len=full_seq_len,
)
model = TensorflowTransAct(transact_config)

user_embedding = model(*input_features)

```

## Run with Docker

You can also run the example script with Docker.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/awadalaa/transact.git
cd transact

docker run -it --rm \
    --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)"/example,target=/usr/src/transact/docker_example \
    ghcr.io/awadalaa/transact:release \
    python docker_example/docker_example.py
```
